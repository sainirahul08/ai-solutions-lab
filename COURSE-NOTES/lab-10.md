## Part A: Understanding Security for AI Systems

### 1. What is Application Security?

**Application security** is the practice of protecting software applications from threats throughout their lifecycle.

#### The CIA Triad

Security professionals use the **CIA Triad** to think about security:

| Principle | Definition | Example in Our AI System |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users can access data | API keys prevent unauthorized access to metrics |
| **Integrity** | Data remains accurate and unmodified | Validate metrics data before storing |
| **Availability** | System remains accessible when needed | Rate limiting prevents DDoS attacks |

### 2. Common Security Threats for AI Applications

#### API Key Leakage
**What it is:** Accidentally exposing API keys in code, git commits, or logs

**Risk:** Attackers can use your API keys to:
- Access your AI system
- Rack up API costs on your account
- Steal sensitive business data

**Real Example:** A student accidentally committed their AWS credentials to GitHub. Within 15 minutes, automated bots found the keys and started mining cryptocurrency on their account. Bill: $2,500.

#### Denial of Service (DoS)
**What it is:** Overwhelming your service with requests until it crashes

**Risk:** Without rate limiting, attackers (or bugs!) can:
- Make thousands of requests per second
- Crash your Flask service
- Max out your AI API quota
- Generate huge cloud bills

#### SQL Injection
**What it is:** Inserting malicious SQL code through user input

**Risk:** Attackers can:
- Read your entire database
- Delete all data
- Modify business information

**Example:**
```python
# VULNERABLE CODE (Never do this!)
query = f"SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE name = '{user_input}'"

# If user_input is: "'; DROP TABLE businesses; --"
# The query becomes: SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE businesses; --'
```

**Safe Approach:** Always use parameterized queries (which our app already does!)

### 3. Security vs Compliance

| Security | Compliance |
|----------|------------|
| **What:** Protecting your system from threats | **What:** Following laws and regulations |
| **Example:** API key authentication | **Example:** GDPR data protection |
| **Who enforces:** Attackers exploit weaknesses | **Who enforces:** Governments fine violations |
| **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access | **Goal:** Handle data ethically and legally |

Both are important! Security keeps attackers out. Compliance keeps you out of legal trouble.

---

## Part B: Secure Environment Variables

### 1. Why Environment Variables Matter

**Environment variables** store sensitive configuration like API keys, database URLs, and secrets.

**❌ Bad Practice:**
```python
# Hardcoded secret in code (NEVER DO THIS!)
API_KEY = "sk-abc123xyz456"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host/db"
```

**Problems:**
- Visible in code
- Committed to git history
- Exposed to anyone with code access
- Can't change without redeploying

**✅ Good Practice:**
```python
# Load from environment variables
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
```

**Benefits:**
- Secrets stay out of code
- Different values per environment (dev, staging, production)
- Easy to rotate/change
- Not committed to git

### 2. Review Current Setup

Check where your secrets are stored:

```bash
cd mlops-service

# View your .env file (contains real secrets)
cat .env

# Check if .env is in .gitignore
cat ../.gitignore | grep .env
```

**Expected Output:**
```
.env
```

✅ Good! `.env` is gitignored and won't be committed.

### 3. Create .env.example Template

The `.env.example` file has already been updated in your `mlops-service/` directory. Let's review it:

```bash
# View the template
cat /mlops-service/.env.example
```

**What's in .env.example:**
- Template with placeholder values
- Comments explaining each variable
- **NO real secrets** (safe to commit to git)
- Instructions for developers to copy and fill in

**Usage:**
```bash
# New team member sets up project:
cp .env.example .env
# Then fills in their actual values
```

### 4. Check Git History for Leaked Secrets

Even if `.env` is currently gitignored, it might have been committed in the past!

```bash
# Search entire git history for .env files
git log --all --full-history -- "*/.env"

# If you find any results, the .env file was committed before!
# In real projects, you'd need to:
# 1. Rotate all leaked credentials
# 2. Use tools like git-secrets or BFG Repo-Cleaner
```

**Expected:** No results (clean history)

### 5. Security Best Practices for Secrets

✅ **DO:**
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Use different secrets for dev/staging/production
- Rotate secrets regularly (quarterly)
- Use secret management tools in production (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Commit `.env` files to git
- Share secrets via email or Slack
- Reuse the same secret across environments
- Log sensitive values (API keys, passwords)

---

## Part C: API Rate Limiting

### 1. What is Rate Limiting?

**Rate limiting** restricts how many requests a user can make in a time period.

**Example:**
```
Rate limit: 100 requests per hour

User makes 100 requests → All allowed
User makes 101st request → Blocked! (429 Too Many Requests)
User waits 1 hour → Counter resets, can make 100 more
```

### 2. Why Rate Limiting is Important

#### Prevent Abuse
- Malicious users can't overwhelm your service
- Bugs (infinite loops) won't crash your system

#### Control Costs
- AI APIs charge per request
- Rate limits cap your maximum spend

#### Ensure Fair Access
- One user can't monopolize resources
- All users get reasonable access

#### Example Scenario Without Rate Limiting:

```
User 1: Accidentally creates infinite loop
        Sends 10,000 requests in 5 minutes

Result:
- Your Flask service crashes
- AI API bill: $500
- Other users can't access service
- You're fired 😱
```

### 3. Understanding Our Rate Limits

Our Flask service now has these rate limits:

| Endpoint | Rate Limit | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| `/` (Dashboard) | No limit | Public page, static content |
| `/health` | 100/minute | Health checks should be frequent |
| `/health/detailed` | 50/minute | More expensive to compute |
| `/metrics` | No limit | Prometheus scrapes frequently |
| `/track` | 100/hour | Metrics tracking, needs protection |
| `/analytics/<id>` | 50/hour | Database queries, more expensive |
| `/refresh-metrics` | 10/hour | Expensive operation |

**Default for other endpoints:** 200/day, 50/hour

### 4. Test Rate Limiting

Let's see rate limiting in action!

#### Start Flask Service

```bash
cd mlops-service
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
🚦 Rate Limiting: ENABLED
```

#### Test Normal Request (Within Limit)

```bash
# Single request - should work
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

**Expected:** Status 200, JSON response

#### Test Rate Limit Exceeded

```bash
# Send 101 requests in a loop (exceeds 100/minute limit)
for i in {1..101}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:5001/health
  echo "Request $i"
done
```

**Expected:**
- First 100 requests: Success (200)
- 101st request: **429 Too Many Requests**

**Response when rate limited:**
```json
{
  "error": "429 Too Many Requests",
  "message": "1 per 1 minute"
}
```

#### View Rate Limit Headers

```bash
# Check rate limit status in headers
curl -I http://localhost:5001/health
```

**Response Headers:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704567890
```

### 5. How Rate Limiting Works

Our implementation uses `flask-limiter`:

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

# Initialize rate limiter
limiter = Limiter(
    get_remote_address,  # Track by IP address
    app=app,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"],
    storage_uri="memory://",  # Store in memory
)

# Apply to endpoint
@app.route('/health')
@limiter.limit("100 per minute")
def health_check():
    return jsonify({'status': 'healthy'})
```

**Key Points:**
- **Tracked by IP address:** Each IP has separate limits
- **Memory storage:** Limits reset when service restarts
- **Per-endpoint:** Different limits for different endpoints

**Production Considerations:**
- Use Redis for persistent storage (limits survive restarts)
- Track by user ID instead of IP (more accurate)
- Implement tiered limits (free users: 100/day, paid: 10,000/day)

---

## Part D: API Key Authentication

### 1. What are API Keys?

**API keys** are secret tokens that identify and authenticate applications.

**Analogy:** An API key is like a house key:
- You need the right key to enter
- Don't share your key with strangers
- Change locks if key is stolen

**Example API Key:**
```
MLOPS_API_KEY=9a7f2c8e5d1b3f6a4e8c9d2f1a7b5c3e
```

### 2. How API Key Authentication Works

**Without Authentication:**
```
User → Request → Flask → ✅ Always accepts
```

**With API Key Authentication:**
```
User → Request with X-API-Key header → Flask → Check key → ✅/❌
```

**Flow:**
1. User includes `X-API-Key: your-key-here` in request header
2. Flask checks if key matches `MLOPS_API_KEY` environment variable
3. If match: ✅ Allow request
4. If no match: ❌ Return 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden

### 3. Generate Secure API Key

**Generate a random API key:**

```bash
# Mac/Linux
openssl rand -hex 32

# Output example:
# 9a7f2c8e5d1b3f6a4e8c9d2f1a7b5c3e8f4d2a6b9c1e7f3a5d8b2c6e4f1a3d7
```

**Copy this key - you'll need it in the next step!**

### 4. Configure API Key

Add your generated API key to `.env`:

```bash
cd mlops-service
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Add this line:**
```
MLOPS_API_KEY=your-generated-key-here
```

**Save and restart Flask service:**
```bash
# Stop current service (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
python app.py
```

**You should see:**
```
🔐 Security: API Key Authentication ENABLED
```

### 5. Test API Key Authentication

#### Request Without API Key (Unauthorized)

```bash
# Try to track metrics without API key
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "business_id": "test",
    "response_time_ms": 100,
    "tokens_used": 50
  }'
```

**Expected Response (401):**
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key required. Include X-API-Key header."
}
```

#### Request With Wrong API Key (Forbidden)

```bash
# Try with incorrect key
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: wrong-key-here" \
  -d '{
    "business_id": "test",
    "response_time_ms": 100,
    "tokens_used": 50
  }'
```

**Expected Response (403):**
```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

#### Request With Correct API Key (Success)

```bash
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key from .env
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "business_id": "test-business",
    "response_time_ms": 150,
    "tokens_used": 75,
    "api_cost_usd": 0.002,
    "intent_detected": "appointment",
    "response_type": "booking",
    "appointment_requested": false
  }'
```

**Expected Response (200):**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Metrics tracked successfully",
  "prometheus_updated": true,
  "database_stored": true,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000000"
}
```

### 6. Understanding the Implementation

The API key check is implemented as a decorator:

```python
def require_api_key(f):
    """
    Decorator to require API key authentication
    """
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # If no API key configured, allow all (dev mode)
        if not MLOPS_API_KEY:
            return f(*args, **kwargs)

        # Check for API key in header
        api_key = request.headers.get('X-API-Key')

        if not api_key:
            return jsonify({
                'error': 'Unauthorized',
                'message': 'API key required. Include X-API-Key header.'
            }), 401

        if api_key != MLOPS_API_KEY:
            return jsonify({
                'error': 'Forbidden',
                'message': 'Invalid API key'
            }), 403

        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

# Apply to endpoint
@app.route('/track', methods=['POST'])
@require_api_key
def track_metrics():
    # Only runs if API key is valid
    ...
```

**Protected Endpoints:**
- `/track` - Metrics submission
- `/analytics/<business_id>` - Analytics data
- `/refresh-metrics` - Metrics refresh

**Public Endpoints (No API Key Required):**
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/health` - Health check
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### 7. Update Next.js to Send API Key (Optional)

If you want to integrate API key authentication with your Next.js app:

**In Next.js `.env.local`:**
```
MLOPS_API_KEY=your-same-api-key-here
```

**In Next.js API route:**
```typescript
// app/api/track-metrics/route.ts
const response = await fetch(`${MLOPS_SERVICE_URL}/track`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': process.env.MLOPS_API_KEY || '',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(metrics),
});
```

## Part E: GDPR Compliance Basics

### 1. What is GDPR?

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** is a European law that protects people's personal data.

**Applies When:**
- Your users are in the European Union
- Your company is based in the EU
- You process EU citizens' data

**Key Principle:** Give users control over their personal data.

### 2. What Data Does Our AI Chat Collect?

| Data Type | Examples | Is it Personal Data? |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **User Messages** | "I want to book an appointment" | ✅ Yes (potentially sensitive) |
| **Email Addresses** | john@example.com | ✅ Yes (identifies person) |
| **Names** | "John Smith" | ✅ Yes |
| **Phone Numbers** | +1-555-1234 | ✅ Yes |
| **Business ID** | uuid-abc-123 | ❌ No (doesn't identify person) |
| **Metrics** | Response time, token count | ❌ No (aggregated, anonymous) |

**Important:** Our AI chat collects personal data! We need to handle it properly.

### 3. GDPR Requirements (Simplified)

#### Lawful Basis for Processing
**Question:** Why are you collecting this data?

**Our Answer:** Providing the service (appointment booking)

#### Consent
**Requirement:** Users must agree to data collection

**Implementation:** Add checkbox/notice in chat interface:
```
☑ I agree to allow this chat to be stored for service purposes.
Privacy Policy
```

#### Right to Access
**Requirement:** Users can request their data

**Implementation:** Provide endpoint to export user's chat history

#### Right to Deletion
**Requirement:** Users can request data deletion

**Implementation:** Provide "delete my data" button/endpoint

#### Data Retention
**Requirement:** Don't keep data longer than necessary

**Implementation:** Delete chat logs after 90 days

### 4. Simple GDPR Checklist for Our Project

**For a college project, we'll implement basic compliance:**

✅ **Inform Users:**
- Add privacy notice: "Your chat messages are stored to provide this service"
- Link to privacy policy (can be simple)

✅ **Data Minimization:**
- Only collect what's needed (email, name for appointments)
- Don't collect unnecessary data (age, address, etc.)

✅ **Data Retention:**
- Plan to delete old chats (conceptual for now)
- Production would implement: `DELETE FROM chats WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'`

✅ **Secure Storage:**
- Database uses SSL (`?sslmode=require` in DATABASE_URL)
- Environment variables secure API keys

### 5. Implementing Data Retention (Conceptual)

**SQL Query to Delete Old Chat Logs:**

```sql
-- Delete chat messages older than 90 days
DELETE FROM chat_messages
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Delete old AI metrics
DELETE FROM ai_metrics
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

**Scheduled Job (Production):**
- Run this query daily via cron job or AWS Lambda
- Log deletions for compliance audit trail

**For Lab 10:** We won't implement the actual scheduled deletion, but understanding the concept is important!

### 6. Privacy Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Be transparent about data collection
- Provide privacy policy
- Implement data retention policies
- Use encryption (HTTPS, SSL database connections)
- Give users control over their data

❌ **DON'T:**
- Collect data you don't need
- Share data with third parties without consent
- Keep data indefinitely
- Log sensitive information (passwords, API keys)

---

## Part F: Security Best Practices Checklist

### Production Security Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your AI application is secured:

#### Environment Variables
- ✅ All secrets in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- ✅ `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.env.example` template in repository
- ✅ Different secrets for dev/staging/production
- ✅ Secrets rotated quarterly

#### API Security
- ✅ API key authentication on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ Rate limiting enabled
- ✅ HTTPS only (in production)
- ✅ CORS configured properly
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints

#### Database Security
- ✅ SSL/TLS encryption enabled (`?sslmode=require`)
- ✅ Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- ✅ Database credentials in environment variables
- ✅ Least privilege principle (app user can't drop tables)

#### Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ Log authentication attempts
- ✅ Don't log sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- ✅ Monitor for suspicious activity
- ✅ Set up alerts for security events

#### Compliance
- ✅ Privacy policy published
- ✅ User consent for data collection
- ✅ Data retention policy defined
- ✅ User data export/deletion available

### What We Implemented in Lab 10

✅ API key authentication
✅ Rate limiting
✅ Secure environment variables
✅ `.env.example` template
✅ GDPR awareness

### What's Left for Real Production

❌ **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** (Industry-standard authentication)
❌ **Data Encryption at Rest** (Encrypt sensitive data in database)
❌ **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** (Block common attacks)
❌ **Security Audit Logging** (Track all access attempts)
❌ **Penetration Testing** (Hire security experts to test)
❌ **Container Scanning** (Check Docker images for vulnerabilities)
❌ **HTTPS Certificates** (SSL/TLS in production)

**Remember:** Lab 10 covers **fundamental security**. Production systems need much more!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Flask won't start after adding flask-limiter

**Error:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_limiter'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
cd mlops-service
pip install flask-limiter==3.5.0
```

### Issue: API key authentication not working

**Symptoms:**
- All requests return 401 Unauthorized
- Even correct API key fails

**Check:**
1. Is `MLOPS_API_KEY` set in `.env`?
```bash
cat .env | grep MLOPS_API_KEY
```

2. Did you restart Flask after updating `.env`?
```bash
# Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart
python app.py
```

3. Is the API key in the header correct?
```bash
# Print your API key
echo $MLOPS_API_KEY  # Mac/Linux
```

### Issue: Rate limit headers not showing

**Symptoms:**
- Requests work but no X-RateLimit-* headers

**This is normal!** Flask-Limiter only adds headers when:
- Rate limit is close to being hit
- Or after hitting the limit

**To see headers:**
```bash
# Make many requests quickly
for i in {1..50}; do curl -I http://localhost:5001/health; done
```

### Issue: Development mode - API key not required

**Symptoms:**
- Requests work without API key
- Logs show: "API Key Authentication DISABLED"

**This is by design!** If `MLOPS_API_KEY` is not set in `.env`, authentication is disabled for easier development.

**To enable:**
1. Generate API key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Add to `.env`: `MLOPS_API_KEY=your-key`
3. Restart Flask

### Issue: Cannot test API key with curl

**Symptoms:**
- curl commands too complex
- Syntax errors

**Simplified test:**
```bash
# Create test file with API key
echo "YOUR_API_KEY" > api_key.txt

# Use file in request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $(cat api_key.txt)" \
  -d '{"business_id":"test","response_time_ms":100,"tokens_used":50}'
```
